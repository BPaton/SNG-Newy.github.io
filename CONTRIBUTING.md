# Contributing to the website

Thank you for thinking about contributing! :smiley:

The point of this file is to make it super easy for you to get involved. So if you have any questions that aren't covered here please let us know! 
Check out the [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below for more details.

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts)
* [Make a change](#make-a-change)
* [Add yourself as a contributor](#add-yourself-as-a-contributor)

## Share your thoughts

Although GitHub calls them **issues**, we'd like you to think of them as **conversation starters**. 
They're our way of communicating across all the members of the team.

(If you're here you ***already are*** a member of the team.)

GitHub has a nice set of help pages if you're looking for more information about [discussing projects in issues][link_discussingissues].

You can find all currently open conversations under the [issues tab][link_issues].

## Make a change

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :tada::smiley:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    Check in with a couple of other members of the team to ensure you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.
    
    [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.
    
2. [Fork][link_fork] the [project repository](https://github.com/LeonieBorne/plstuto) to your profile.

    You can now do whatever you want with this copy of the project. You won't mess up anyone else's work so you're super safe.
    
    Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository.

3. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much easier!

4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].
    
    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:
