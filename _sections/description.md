Systems Neuroscience is an approach to brain sciences that seeks the basic principles of brain organization, dynamics and function across a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales. Systems Neuroscience can also make contributions to our understanding of neurological and mental health disorders by viewing function and dysfunction from a common perspective.

The work of our group embodies these principles across two broad domains - computational neuroscience and translational neuroimaging. The overarching aim of this work is to contribute to new insights into adaptive brain function and new predictive and diagnostic tests for brain disorders. Beneath such lofty goals are a bunch of often gruelling, specific and highly technical details to which we are also happy to devote time and endless cups of coffee.

We are funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Australian research Council and philanthropy.
