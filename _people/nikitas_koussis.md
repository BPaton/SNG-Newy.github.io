## Research Interests
I am very interested in the cognitive symptoms of psychosis
and more generally in the functioning and structure of the 
human brain in pathology and mental illness. 
My work focuses on approaching cognitive dysfunction in psychosis using a Bayesian approach. I hope to describe mechanisms of gain and attention within an interference framework. I utilise functional, diffusion and structural neuroimaging, as well as behavioural and cognitive paradigms, and computational approaches to cognition.

## Biography
I am Greek and Australian, and have Gamilaraay heritage on my Australian side. Upon completing a Bachelor of Science at Queensland University of Technology in 2017, I worked at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute as assistant to PI on the Prospective Imaging Study of Ageing; an AQIP grant and several other projects. I am currently completing a PhD at University of Newcastle under Michael Breakspear. In my spare time I write fantasy books and do carpentry.
