## Research Interests
I am passionate about the use of artificial intelligence in medical imaging. 
My work aims to develop intelligent algorithms to help the analysis of these images, notably using deep learning. 

## Deep learning for cortical fold study
After a master's degree in artificial intelligence, I did my PhD at Neurospin in France. 
My PhD work focused on the development of several **structural MRI analysis** pipelines using **machine learning** algorithms, including **deep learning**. 
The tools I developed are now available in the BrainVISA toolbox ([www.brainvisa.info](www.brainvisa.info)), to help researchers study the link between the fold shape and brain function. 

## Brain-behaviour association in dementia
Following my PhD, I started a postdoc in 2020 in the Systems Neuroscience Group where I applied my skills to address the challenges of dementia. 
Using **advanced statistical analysis**, I have notably identified a robust association between brain atrophy and cognitive decline during the **preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease**. 
My work is based on the databases [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/), [AIBL](https://aibl.csiro.au/) and [PISA](https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/pisa/).
