<h2> <span style="background-color:black;"> Control in an imprecise world:
the cognitive control network, schizophrenia and active inference  </span></h2>

    <p><div style="background-color:black;">Disruption and dysfunction of cognitive processes is a hallmark of schizophrenia, appearing in early stages of illness. 
    The dysconnectivity theory suggests that the core pathology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia is impairment in functional integration of neural systems.

    This study utilises structural MR imaging to identify the inter-group differences between healthy controls and early psychosis patients, as well as covariates of task performance. 
    <a href="https://sng-newy.github.io/people.html#nikitas-koussis">Nikitas Koussis</a> will study how individual differences lead to specific disease outcomes in early psychosis patients. 
    Participants are scanned at baseline and 12 months to provide a late neurodevelopment perspective.
    <a href="https://sng-newy.github.io/people.html#nikitas-koussis">Nikitas Koussis</a> will examine associations of symptom severity and relapse to patterns of structural connectivity reconstructed from patients with early psychosis.

Identification of intrinsic brain network properties may lead to biomarkers for diagnostic outlook, leading to risk stratification and personalised therapy for this vulnerable population.
