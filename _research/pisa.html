<h2> Prospective Imaging Study of Ageing (PISA):
Genes, Brain & Behaviour </h2>

    <p>The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) begins several decades before the first cognitive symptoms appear. 
    This preclinical phase of the disease is of tremendous interest since novel disease-modifying treatments may be possible during this period. 
    However, as people at high future risk of AD are hard to identify, few studies have focused on it. 
    The <a href="https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/pisa/">Prospective Imaging Study of Ageing</a> (PISA) 
    focus on healthy mid-life Australians at high genetic risk of developing AD
    to identify subtle cognitive and brain changes linked to the preclinical phase of AD.
    
    Our first preliminary results of this study include:
    (1) Evidence of a robust link between cognitive decline and widening of cortical folds associated with progression to dementia.
    (2) Prediction of AD using algorithms trained on healthy mid-life and older adults.
    (3) Evidence that memory tests alone are insufficient to study the preclinical stage of AD and that other cognitive tests, 
    such as those related to executive functions, are required to best identify individuals at risk.
