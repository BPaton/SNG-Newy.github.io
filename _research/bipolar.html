<h2> Functional and structural brain networks in persons at high risk of bipolar disorder. </h2>

    <p> This ongoing collaboration with researchers at the University of NSW and University of Cambridge is now in the follow-up stage broadening 
    into a longitudinal study of brain changes in a high-risk cohort. With the objective now being to better understand the progression of bipolar disorder (BD), 
    given unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with BD have an odds ratio of ~7â€“14 of developing BD.</p>
   <p> Following on from previously published work on the initial brain imaging dataset 
   (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-018-0267-2">Perry et al. (2019)</a>,
   <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291717003233">Frankland et al. (2018)</a>,

   and other broader research, structural and functional dysconnection amongst key brain networks supporting 
   cognitive and affective processes have been highlighted in both persons with BD diagnosis and high-risk relatives. Work currently under review aimed 
   to compare longitudinal structural connectivity changes in individuals at high genetic risk for BD to those without a family history of mental illness. 
   Network-based statistics revealed that on-top of shared maturation changes in structural connectivity over time, high risk participants showed a subset 
   of regions with weakened connectivity as compared to age-matched controls. This work to provides insight into and may present a candidate for predicting 
   conversion to BD.
