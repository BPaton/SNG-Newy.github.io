## **ADNeT**

The [Australian Dementia Networks](https://www.australiandementianetwork.org.au/) (ADNeT) is an NHMRC funded research program which is bringing together 
Australia’s leading researchers, clinicians and consumers to create a powerful network for dementia prevention, treatment and care. 
[Michael Breakspear](https://sng-newy.github.io/people.html#michael-breakspear) is heading the ADNeT technology arm partnering with CSIRO, 
providing a harmonised platform and protocols across state and territory jurisdictions for the acquisition, storage and sharing of data for dementia research
– a first for Australia. [Renate Thienel](https://sng-newy.github.io/people.html#renate-thienel) is coordination the Newcastle ADNeT Screening and Trials arm, 
which seeks to reduce the duration of clinical trials in order to fast-track the development of effective therapies to prevent or treat dementia. 
[Léonie Borne](https://sng-newy.github.io/people.html#l%C3%A9onie-borne) is working as a post-doctoral fellow on ADNeT, using machine learning to developing 
algorithms to identify suitable participants for clinical trials.
