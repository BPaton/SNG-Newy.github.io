Systems Neuroscience is an approach to brain sciences that seeks the basic principles of brain organization, 
dynamics and function across a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales. It is a rapidly growing field that differs considerably 
from the traditional reductionist paradigm in neuroscience that addresses sufficient causes for local phenomena.

The work of our group embodies these principles across three broad domains -empirical, computational and clinical neuroscience. 
The overarching aim of this work is to contribute towards unifying models of brain architecture, dynamics and cognitive (dys)function.
Beneath such lofty goals, are a bunch of often gruelling, specific and highly technical details to which we are also happy to devote 
time and endless cups of coffee.

We are funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (a Program Grant and a Dementia Research Team Grant) and a clinical 
collaborative award from QIMR Berghofer.
