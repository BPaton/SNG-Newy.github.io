Welcome on the SNG Github Page!


# Add your profile

You will have to add file of your image to the assets/images folder and modify the file _config.yml.

So here are the steps you need to do to make a pull request to do so.

1. **Find the profile image you want to add**

2. **Fork the repository to create a copy of it your github account**

You can find more information about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

3. **Clone the repository from your github account to your computer**

```
git clone https://github.com/_YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_/SNG-Newy.github.io
```

4. **Create a new branch where you want to add your profile, and switch to that branch**

```
git branch YOUR_NAME-profile
git checkout YOUR_NAME-profile
```

5. **Add the image file**

Put a copy of your image in the assets/images folder and rename it with your name like YOUR_NAME.jpg.

6. **Modify the _config.yml**

7. **Add and then commit all the changes you have made**

```
git add --all
git commit -m 'adding my profile'
```

8. **Update your github repository by pushing to it the changes made on the repository on your computer**

```
git push
```

9. **Open a pull request**

Go and open a pull request page from the SNG-Newy.github.io repository.

We (and the magic of automation) will take care of the rest. :-)
